Alpha Wallet

Work in Progress(Testable)


VERSION 1.1

11/17/2018

NOTES

Fund the Wallet with $A and a small amount of ether(.0005 will do) or it will not work correctly

Some browsers do not function well with the use of this Dapp

2fa functions will come soon!

iOS users will gain functionality in the next patch(We hope)

Also for the next patch...Additional ERC20 tokens...Possibly the in-wallet exchange as well

We will be adding a setting to adjust gwei in the next patch as well!

Details.

If you do not have an ERC20 wallet you can create one(Stores all ERC20s)

Gas prices default to the LOWEST settings via the ethereum network


Please note there are no limits in place at this time. We will soon add more complexity to protect our users...but if you enter in incorrect inputs for the Address/Amount This can cause loss of funds!

The Default address is the $A wallet and we do always accept contributions! =)
