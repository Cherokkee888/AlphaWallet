Alpha Wallet

Work in Progress(Testable)


VERSION 1.1

11/17/2018

NOTES

Some browsers do not function well with the use of this Dapp

2fa functions will come soon!

iOS users will gain functionality in the next patch(We hope)

Gas prices default to the LOWEST settings for sends of our lighteight token

We will be adding a setting to adjust gwei in the next patch as well!

Please note there are no limits in place at this time. We will soon add more complexity to protect our users...but if you enter in incorrect inputs for the Address/Amount This can cause loss of funds!

The Default address is the $A wallet and we do always accept contributions! =)
