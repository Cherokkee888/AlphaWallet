Alpha Wallet

Work in Progress(Testable)


VERSION 1.1

11/17/2018

NOTES

Some browsers do not function well with the use of this Dapp

2fa functions will come soon!

iOS users will gain functionality in the next patch(We hope)

Also for the next patch...Additional ERC20 tokens...Possibly the in-wallet exchange as well

We will be adding a setting to adjust gwei in the next patch as well!

Details.

Gas prices default to the LOWEST settings via the ethereum network

Load .002 ether into the wallet and you will be able to use it with ease.


Please note there are no limits in place at this time. We will soon add more complexity to protect our users...but if you enter in incorrect inputs for the Address/Amount This can cause loss of funds!

The Default address is the $A wallet and we do always accept contributions! =)
